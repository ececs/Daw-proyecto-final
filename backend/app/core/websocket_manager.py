"""
WebSocket connection manager.

This module manages the lifecycle of all active WebSocket connections.
It is the bridge between server-side events (PostgreSQL NOTIFY messages)
and connected browser clients.

Architecture:
  - Each authenticated user can have multiple browser tabs/windows open,
    each with its own WebSocket connection.
  - Connections are stored in a dict keyed by user_id (UUID).
  - The value is a list of WebSocket objects (one per open tab).

When a notification must be delivered to user X:
  1. PostgreSQL triggers a NOTIFY with the user's UUID as the channel.
  2. The asyncpg listener (in main.py lifespan) calls manager.broadcast_to_user().
  3. The manager sends the JSON payload to all active connections for that user.
  4. If a connection is broken (client disconnected), it is removed gracefully.
