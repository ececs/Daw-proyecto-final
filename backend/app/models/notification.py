"""Notification database model and triggering enumeration schemas.

Notifications are created automatically by the system when specific events occur:
  - A ticket is assigned to a user → notify the assignee
  - A comment is added to a ticket → notify the author and current assignee
  - A ticket's status changes → notify author and assignee

They are delivered in real-time via WebSockets (see ws.py) using PostgreSQL
LISTEN/NOTIFY. The `read` flag tracks which notifications the user has seen,
which drives the unread badge count in the frontend.
