"""
Attachment Service Module.

Orchestrates file storage (via storage_service) and database metadata 
management for ticket attachments.

Architecture (Senior Pattern):
- Decoupling: Returns Pydantic schemas (`AttachmentOut`) instead of models.
- Resilience: Gracefully handles storage failures when retrieving presigned URLs.
