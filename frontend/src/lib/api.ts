/**
 * API client — axios instance configured for the FastAPI backend.
 *
 * Cross-domain auth strategy:
 *  - The JWT is stored as a readable (non-httpOnly) cookie on the Vercel domain.
 *  - The Next.js proxy reads it server-side for route protection.
 *  - The request interceptor below reads it client-side and attaches it as an
 *    Authorization: Bearer header so the Railway backend (different domain) can
 *    authenticate each request. Browsers don't share cookies across domains, so
 *    withCredentials alone is not sufficient here.
